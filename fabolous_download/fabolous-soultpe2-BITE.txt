[Intro: Sample from an interview with Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas is tryin to eat, that's all I look at it as niggas wanna eat food
Niggas is tired of bein on the streets niggas is tired of robbin and stealin
Niggas is tired of sellin drugs, and tryin to get some money
Niggas is tired of bein on the corner fucked up

[Fabolous]:
Rest in peace to the late great Christopher Wallace
I mean even though your gone, that mentality lives on

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Every single day, each and every night B.I.T.E. 
That's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
Every single day, each and every night B.I.T.E. 
That's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., now what that mean
I say bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat
B.I.T.E. that's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
Bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat
B.I.T.E. that's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
 
[Verse One: Fabolous]
I said bow yo' head to yo' hood, bless the streets that I eat on
So cold in my city, best believe that that heat's on
Bitch I'm tryna eat before it's rest in peace and my teeth stoned
Want my eggs scrambled hard with extra cheese and a t-bone
Got a recipe in these streets homes, taste the hustle, extra muscle
Make a mil' called success, now I ain't say you 'gon duck stress
I ain't say it don't come with pain, couple of losers 'gon come with gain
They ain't eatin got stomach pains they callin you but yo' number changed
Old friendships they strange, couple words might get exchanged
New niggas since diapers, oh well guess shit has changed 
My teacher came to me, ask the same to me, what I'm tryna be?
And I said B.I.T.E.
Uh!

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Every single day, each and every night B.I.T.E. 
That's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
Every single day, each and every night B.I.T.E. 
That's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., now what that mean
I say bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat
B.I.T.E. that's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
Bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat
B.I.T.E. that's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
Look! I ain't grow up on Park Place, where I'm from it's a dark place
Hardly look on that bright side, mean skies be dark grey
In arcades get a narc case in the P.A. arcade
Wasn't tryna be Scarface shit I just wanted the new Barkley's
If lil' fish get fed to sharks I'm tryin to see how that shark taste
Ask them with that shark face I'm tryna feel my park space
I'm tryna be in my dark shades on the parkay at the Barclays
I'm tryna get my money long,long as Eastern Parkway
Me and my niggas got reservations, no wait no hesitations
Non stop, to the money, that's my final destination
The judge looked at me, asked the same of me, what you tryna plea?
And I said B.I.T.E.
Uh!

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Every single day, each and every night B.I.T.E. 
That's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
Every single day, each and every night B.I.T.E. 
That's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., now what that mean
I say bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat
B.I.T.E. that's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
Bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat
B.I.T.E. that's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.

[Outro: Fabolous]
Bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat, B.I.T.E
Bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat, B.I.T.E
Bitch I'm tryna eat, bitch I'm tryna eat, B.I.T.E
That's my word, I'm screamin B.I.T.E., I'm screamin B.I.T.E.
